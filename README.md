A raw and simple script to automate the process of multiple Firebase users deletion.

```
1. Go to the Firebase authentication page with the users list.
2. Copy and paste the full script code into the browser console.
3. Run the main function from the console passing the number of users you want to delete.
```

The script will delete users one by one from the top of the users table.

You can sort users before the script execution if you want to.
